<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">1 </span>Hilbert on the pursuit of knowledge</h2>

<div id="S1.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In the Summer of 1900 the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Second International Congress of Mathematicians</em> took place in Paris and Hilbert’s paper to the Congress has the form of a statement of the strategical goals to be pursued by the discipline. But in his paper Hilbert not only drew up a chart of the resulting future profile of the discipline but he also reflected on the human faculty which makes mathematical experience possible.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">We can therefore distinguish two main components in Hilbert’s strategy.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">One first component was his chart, which took the form of the today well known list of twenty three problems, the solution of which would then enrich the discipline with ever new goals and methods. With the benefit of hindsight we can see today that not only the list of problems revealed to be a happy choice, but that some of their solutions did indeed deliver the announced new directions.</p>
</div>
<div id="S1.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The second component was the already mentioned reflection on the human faculty that makes mathematical experience possible, as it reveals itself in pattern recognition and in particular in problem solving. Indeed for Hilbert it is only the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">existence of problems</span> that makes the pursuit of knowledge alive. And this results from the experienced fact that only the search for the solution of a problem provides the inspiration needed to discover new patterns of inference.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="S2" class="ltx_section">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">2 </span>The two sources of mathematical knowledge</h2>

<div id="S2.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">As to the source from which the growth of mathematical knowledge is obtained Hilbert sees in first place, in accordance with the then dominating <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Zeitgeist</em>, the pressures that result from an attempt to understand the external world by means of physical theories. Accordingly, only the solution of Problem number 6 in his chart will provide the axioms of physical theories with the certainty enjoyed by mathematical theories.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">But the success obtained in the solution of problems concerning external reality will enrich the mathematician’s mind with the insight about <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">its own independence</span>. He will then be able to discover within the mind new problems, which <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">prima facie</em> do not depend on physical stimulation. This stimulation will be replaced by permutations of logical patterns, the best examples of which are the introduction and the elimination of quantifiers in inferential thinking and above all in the decomposition or analysis of a concept in its constituent parts. This new realm of experience will not eliminate the pressures from the external world, but it will turn out that these pressures are better addressed if the insights gained in pure thought are brought to bear on their solution.</p>
</div>
<div id="S2.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is this recurring shift from objective reality to mental experience that gives rise to a form of leibnizian pre-established homology between the conceptual structure of (only) apparently diverse domains of knowledge.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="S3" class="ltx_section">
<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">3 </span>Hilbert’s epistemological optimism</h2>

<div id="S3.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">This homology of conceptual structure applies also within mathematics itself, and accordingly Hilbert rejected the then popular misconception that the definition of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">mathematical rigor</span> was only attainable in number theory, eventually also in analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">His view was that if a mathematical concept is prompted by considerations in geometry, physics or even epistemology, the mathematician’s task is to bring to light the underlying properties buried in the concept, and articulate them in set of axioms. In this way the rigor of the reasoning about the new concept is secured by proofs that have the same logical necessity of the proofs in number theory.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Therefore the object of mathematics is to unfold the deductive structure of systems of concepts. In view of the fact that every consistent set of axioms has a model, it would seem reasonable to argue that the <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">choice of axioms</span> is also forced upon us by requirements of evidence, either towards physical experience or towards the previously built body of mathematical knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Thus for Hilbert the rewarded effort found in solving whatever problems present themselves to the mathematician’s consideration creates the unshakable conviction that <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">every problem has a solution which can be found by pure thought</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">He therefore rejected Kant’s position according to which the human mind has the uncanny ability to formulate problems for which it can find no solution, the so called paralogisms of pure reason.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Hilbert on the contrary was an adept of a form of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">epistemological optimism</span> which he very well captured in his <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">motto</em>:</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p7" class="ltx_para">
<blockquote class="ltx_quote">
<p class="ltx_p"><em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">"Wir müssen wissen, wir werden wissen</em>!"

<br class="ltx_break"></p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="S3.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">He expected of course that his optimism in the power of the mind to solve problems that the mind itself it is able to formulate, would also apply to his Tenth Problem, concerning the development of a decision procedure for the solution of Diophantine equations.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">The mathematical proof that this optimism is unfounded is due to Matijasevicz.</p>
</div>
<div id="S3.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">But we report now on a very profound logical and epistemological examination of the network of questions involved in Hilbert’s optimism, due to K. Gödel, and begin by introducing some background material which will prove useful to fully appreciate Gödel’s contribution.</p>

<h2 class="ltx_title ltx_title_section">
<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">4 </span><em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">Stricto sensu</em> and conditional mathematics</h2>

<div id="S4.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In spite of the fact that the nature of mathematical knowledge has been a recurring theme since Classical Antiquity, the relevant results that support an informed analysis of its limits have only been available since the early XX century. Two such results are due to Gödel and they will in the sequel be referred to as <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">Propositions I and II</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">[The reader interested in a logical and formal exposition of these propositions (and their proofs) may find useful to read the PM entry "beyond formalism: Gödel’s incompleteness" (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://planetmath.org/BeyondFormalism</span>).]</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A third foundational result should be mentioned, namely the successful analysis of the concept of "finite procedure" by A. Turing.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">A significant measure of this success lies in the fact that although the concept can be defined in a variety of ways, the resulting definitions always turn out to be equivalent. In essence, for Turing, a finite procedure is a machine whose component parts are finite in number.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Now the existing contrast, familiar in natural deduction systems, between a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">proof from a premiss</span> (or a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">conditional proof</span>) and a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">proof from the empty set of premises</span> (or an <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">absolute proof</span>), suggests the use of a similar partition of mathematical theorems. We will then have on one side the class of all theorems that are true conditionally, like the theorems of a hypothetical-deductive system in plane geometry, and on the other side the class of all those theorems that are true in an absolute sense. It is in this case that we say that the theorems are true <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stricto sensu</em>, and we want to call the set of all such theorems <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_bold ltx_font_italic">stricto sensu</em><span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold"> mathematics</span>. In the domain of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stricto sensu</em> mathematics we will include formal logic and recursive arithmetic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p6" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">There is however a small difficulty with the definition of the space of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stricto sensu</em> mathematics and it results from the fact that the concept "formal logic", used in the description of the domain, can be interpreted in more than one way.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p7" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">For example, in the PM entry "intuitionistic logic" (<span class="ltx_text ltx_font_typewriter">http://planetmath.org/IntuitionisticLogic</span>) there is a list of classical logical principles the universal validity of which is questioned by intuitionistic logic.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p8" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">It is to be observed that in this conception <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stricto sensu</em> mathematics is a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">necessary condition</span> of conditional mathematics, since without the absolute validity of some logical principles, like <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">modus ponens</em>, the proofs of the theorems of conditional mathematics could not be established.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p9" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Of course the difficulties about the above mentioned definition of the space of <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">stricto sensu</em> mathematics depend on a previously adopted position in mathematical philosophy. This is very obviously revealed in the dispute about the universal validity of the <em class="ltx_emph ltx_font_italic">tertium non datur</em> or about the significance of the general concept of set.</p>
</div>
<div id="S4.p10" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">But in any case Propositions I and II have not only proven the existence of the incompleteness phenomenon, but have above all also shown that this phenomenon is independent of a previously adopted position in mathematical philosophy.</p>

<span class="ltx_tag ltx_tag_section">5 </span>The cumulative hierarchy</h2>

<div id="S5.p1" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">That this phenomenon does not depend not a previously accepted foundational position can be best shown by turning our attention to one of the most natural of all foundational positions, the axiomatic theory of sets.
</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p2" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Indeed we have the striking fact that the accepted body of mathematical knowledge has a most natural representation in the network of concepts of <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">axiomatic set theory</span>. But if we now try to identify the incompleteness phenomenon in the process of formulating the axioms for set theory, we become aware of the following contrast:</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p3" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Whereas one can formulate the axioms of some mathematical theories with a finite number of axioms (an example of which is geometry), the formulation of the axioms of abstract set theory requires an infinite number of axioms.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p4" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">In particular one can always reiterate extensions for the formulated axioms and it is not possible to bring all this body of rules <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">under a single finite rule</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="S5.p5" class="ltx_para">
<p class="ltx_p">Under these circumstances Gödel has suggested that in order to maintain the theory immune to the paradoxes one has to adopt a <span class="ltx_text ltx_font_bold">gradual</span> approach to axiomatization, along the stages of a cumulative hierarchy, the primitive function of which, <math id="S5.p5.m1" class="ltx_Math" alttext="\mathfrak{P}" display="inline"><mi>𝔓</mi></math>, builds the power set of a given set.</p>

<p class="ltx_p">Now it turns out that for the development of present day mathematics the really relevant stages are the first three. That in turn means that the initial project of carrying out an axiomatization with a finite number of axioms is after all a possibility.

<p class="ltx_p">But this possibility does not weaken the significance of the cumulative hierarchy.
